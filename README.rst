RoboHash
========

The source code for `RoboHash.org`_.

It basically copy/pastes various robot pictures together, using bits
from the SHA hash. It’s not perfect, and not entirely secure, but it
gives a good gut-check to “Hey, this SHA is wrong.”

Install
-------

Just the library:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install robohash

Or if you also want the web frontend:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install robohash[web]

Usage
-----

.. code:: python

    from robohash import Robohash

    hash = "whatever-hash-you-want"
    rh = Robohash(hash)
    rh.assemble(roboset='any')
    with open("path/to/new/file.png", "w") as f:
        rh.img.save(f, format="png")

Robosets
--------

RoboHash comes with three image sets, named “set1”, “set2”, and “set3”.
Specify which set you want in the ``assemble()`` method. Alternatively,
specify the string “any”, and RoboHash will pick an image set for you,
based on the provided hash.

The “set1” artwork was created by Zikri Kader. The “set2” artwork was
created by Hrvoje Novakovic. The “set3” artwork was created by Julian
Peter Arias.

Disclaimer

OK, I’ll admit I’m a best programmer. Compounding this, I wrote this
code initially to be internal-only. It’s ugly, and could be a LOT nicer.

This tool is amazing thank you very much :)
